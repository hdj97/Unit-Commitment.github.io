6-Bus System:
The three generators need to meet the hourly system power demand.
Hourly system power demand: 166.4, 156, 150.8, 145.6, 145.6, 150.8, 166.4, 197.6, 226.2, 247, 257.4, 260, 257.4, 260, 260, 252.2, 249.6, 249.6, 241.8, 239.2, 239.2, 241.8, 226.2, 187.2.

First UCMNM scenario:
Each MG is assigned a DER to satisfy the hourly power demand.
Hourly system power demand: 16, 18, 20, 22, 25, 30, 34, 37, 42, 39, 36, 35, 34, 41, 41, 40, 43, 45, 40, 38, 34, 32, 30, 24.

Second UCMNM scenario:
The time planned is expanded from 24 hours to 168 hours (i.e., one week).
the hourly power demand of the network is proportionally reduced by 10% every other day.
Hourly system power demand: 16, 18, 20, 22, 25, 30, 34, 37, 42, 39, 36, 35, 34, 41, 41, 40, 43, 45, 40, 38, 34, 32, 30, 24; 16, 18, 20, 22, 25, 30, 34, 37, 42, 39, 36, 35, 34, 41, 41, 40, 43, 45, 40, 38, 34, 32, 30, 24; 14.4, 16.2, 18, 19.8, 22.5, 27, 30.6, 33.3, 37.8, 35.1, 32.4, 31.5, 30.6, 36.9, 36.9, 36, 38.7, 40.5, 36, 34.2, 30.6, 28.8, 27, 21.6; 14.4, 16.2, 18, 19.8, 22.5, 27, 30.6, 33.3, 37.8, 35.1, 32.4, 31.5, 30.6, 36.9, 36.9, 36, 38.7, 40.5, 36, 34.2, 30.6, 28.8, 27, 21.6; 12.8, 14.4, 16, 17.6, 20, 24, 27.2, 29.6, 33.6, 31.2, 28.8, 28, 27.2, 32.8, 32.8, 32, 34.4, 36, 32, 30.4, 27.2, 25.6, 24, 19.2; 12.8, 14.4, 16, 17.6, 20, 24, 27.2, 29.6, 33.6, 31.2, 28.8, 28, 27.2, 32.8, 32.8, 32, 34.4, 36, 32, 30.4, 27.2, 25.6, 24, 19.2; 11.2, 12.6, 14, 15.4, 17.5, 21, 23.8, 25.9, 29.4, 27.3, 25.2, 24.5, 23.8, 28.7, 28.7, 28, 30.1, 31.5, 28, 26.6, 23.8, 22.4, 21, 16.8.

Third UCMNM scenario:
Each MG consists of three schedulable DERs, and the power is generated by 9 schedulable DERs cooperatively.
Hourly system power demand: 50, 55, 60, 60, 70, 78, 80, 90, 100, 105, 95, 95, 90, 100, 110, 120, 125, 130, 115, 109, 100, 90, 80, 70.
